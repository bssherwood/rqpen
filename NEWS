rqPen 1.2 (Release date: 2015-10-13)
==============
Changes:

* Added group penalty function with two implementations. QICD, a coordinate descent approach, and a linear programming approach.
* New functions for group penalties include: groupQICD, groupQICDMultLambda and nonzero
* Added coefficient functions for cv.rq.group.pen and cv.rq.pen
* Added kernel based weight functions kernel_estimates and kernel_weights. These will be for future implementations that use inverse weighting as an approach for handling missing data.
