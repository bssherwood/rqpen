rqPen 1.4 (Release date: 2016-04-20)
==============
Changes: 

* Introduced penVars, which allows users to select a subset of variables to be penalized.
* QICD algorithm implemented for rq.nc.fit and is default if p > 50. 
* QICD algorithm has not been implemented for group penalties, yet. 

rqPen 1.3 (Release date: 2016-02-08)
==============
Changes:

* Fixed bug that caused cv.rq.pen to be doing k-folds cross validation incorrectly.  
* QICD approach should be considered in work. Future updates will include a more vetted and faster algorithm.

rqPen 1.2 (Release date: 2015-10-13)
==============
Changes:

* Added group penalty function with two implementations. QICD, a coordinate descent approach, and a linear programming approach.
* New functions for group penalties include: groupQICD, groupQICDMultLambda and nonzero
* Added coefficient functions for cv.rq.group.pen and cv.rq.pen
* Added kernel based weight functions kernel_estimates and kernel_weights. These will be for future implementations that use inverse weighting as an approach for handling missing data.

rqPen 1.1 (Release date: 2015-03-15)
==============

Changes:

* Corrected errors in SCAD and MCP penalties
* Combined scad_1_deriv and scad_2_deriv into one function scad_deriv
* swapped order of weights and lambda in functions rq.lasso.fit, rq.nc.fit and cv.rq.pen
