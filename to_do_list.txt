1. criteria cv for cv.rq.pen with qicd algorithm 
2. Update choice of lambda for all penalties
3. Warm starts in cv functions
4. Need to look into penVar 
5. rq.group.fit returns SCAD as penalty when it is actually LASSO 
6. rq.lasso.modelreturn used for returning non-lasso penalties, but then penRho is calculated incorrectly. Adaptive lasso is particularly problematic, but should review all cases.
