\description{
Warning: function is no longer exported. Recommend using rq.group.pen() instead. 
Similar to cv.rq.pen function, but uses group penalty. Group penalties use the L1 norm instead of L2 for computational convenience. 
As a result of this the group lasso penalty is the same as the typical lasso penalty and thus you should only use a SCAD or MCP penalty. 
Only the SCAD and MCP penalties incorporate the group structure into the penalty. The group lasso penalty is implemented because it is 
needed for the SCAD and MCP algorithm. We use a group penalty extension of the QICD algorithm presented by Peng and Wang (2015).
