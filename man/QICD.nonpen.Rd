\arguments{
\item{y}{response variable, length n vector}

\item{x}{input nxp matrix, of dimension nobs x nvars; each row is an observation vector.}

\item{z}{nxq matrix of bases; the coefficients for these columns will be unpenalized}

\item{tau}{the quantile value}

\item{lambda}{the tuning parameter (numeric value > 0)}

\item{intercept}{a logical value,should intercept be fitted (default=TRUE) (intercept should be included when using splines)}

\item{penalty}{The name of the penalty function ("SCAD", "MCP", "LASSO")}

\item{initial_beta}{Vector containing initial values for intercept (if included) and x coefficients. Should be in the form (intercept, coefficients) intercept should be left out if intercept=FALSE. The intercept should be included to be consistent with other methods, but intercept and z coefficients will be initialized to by a rq() fit of residuals from initial beta against the unpenalized predictors, z.}

\item{maxin}{maximum number of iterations for inside coordinate descent,default value is 100}

\item{maxout}{maximum number of iterations for outside MM step, default value is 20}

\item{eps}{The convergence threshold for coordinate descent and majorization minimization step}

\item{coef.cutoff}{Threshold for determining nonzero coefficients}

\item{a}{Scale parameter, the default value is 3.7 (>2 for SCAD, >1 for MCP, not used in LASSO)}

\item{method}{quantile regression initialization method, can be "br" or "fn".}

\item{scalex}{Whether predictors are centered and scaled}

\item{...}{additional parameters}
